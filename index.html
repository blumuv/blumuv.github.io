						<h2>How I got started müving...</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I started with an exercise routine and progressively changed it as well as my diet but my skin was at its worst. It could've been stress, or the lack of attention I was giving to myself, lacking love towards myself. That is when I decided to change the things I was not happy with. I separated, I could not stand to be in a situation that was destroying me, making me sink into a depression for silencing my emotions. Each year it has been something different. The first one it was my body, the second it was mi diet and my skin. The third was my relationship with the universe, the fourth was finding my passion, which is THIS, with the hope of being able to help others find their "playground" by exploring, experimenting, and using curiosity, compassion and letting go in which to find real peace. My skin is like its never been before, I feel emotionally and physically strong, like never before.

						I give thanks to God for what I have lived because without it I would never have found this, equilibrium with which works to my advantage phisically, mentally and spiritually.</p>
